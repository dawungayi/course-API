Course Management API is a REST API which manages different courses with CRUD ability using MySQL database. The Course resources are organized under Topic resources. This API is built with Spring Boot 2.4.0., using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). This project starts off from the [Spring Boot Quick Start Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msXL2oDexqw&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTbx8p2oCgcAQGQyqN8XeA1x) by JavaBrains on Youtube, and adds support for persistent data thanks to MySQL.
